Looking To The Sky:
Sweet yearning from the depths of my soul.
Blessed is my mind that drinks of this knowledge.
Though stubborn at first, rejecting its hand.
I have learned to accept it as my only salvation.
From the streets which have long been my home.
I look to the skies and the clouds above.
Through my skills I shall rise, so I may catch the stars.
Even if the journey might be as heavy as stone.
